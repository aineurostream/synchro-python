Thank you. Thank you very much. Let me thank Dr. Haas and CFR for this invitation. Very happy to be here. In my opening remarks, I will briefly explain our reading of today's global outlook and the Turkish-U.S. relations. Then we can go into more specific issues during the Q&A. The system established by the Peace of Westphalia lasted for more than 150 years. Then the system of Vienna Congress continued for about a century. The Cold War lasted around half a century. The brief relief period just after the Cold War lasted a short while only. And now, today's age is increasingly marked by uncertainty. So we see a pattern here. systems lifespans get shorter, and periods of uncertainty tend to extend. And we face common challenges such as climate change, conflicts, terrorism, food and security, energy security. There is also a competition between those asking for a rules-based and a law-based order. In any case, we need a serious reform of international system towards one that will be based on cooperation. Dear friends, dear guests, as the saying goes, geography is destiny. And many rightly argue that geography is back. A simple look at the map is enough to see how volatile Turkey's geography is. the Middle East, the Black Sea, the Caucasus, the Balkans, Russia, Ukraine, Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Africa, all in our vicinity. And Turkey is a leading actor in all these major foreign policy files. 60% of the conflicts are in our surrounding regions. And we are also directly involved in tackling other global challenges, such as migration, energy security I just mentioned, and food security, and terrorism. And we need to pursue a proactive foreign policy to minimize the effects of these conflicts to our stability and welfare. After all, Turkey is a market economy that is integrated to global markets.
