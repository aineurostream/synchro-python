The same goes for humans. The epigenome reacts to absolutely everything: to physical activity, to the absence of it, to gas emissions in the atmosphere, how much sleep you had today, what you ate today, and so on. Nothing goes unnoticed. This is the epigenome. It is our invisible language of communication, which we use literally every day, but don’t even notice. Now, after I’ve told you about the epigenome, we can talk about my topic—genomic imprinting. It’s no secret that we are the product of our parents’ love. We inherit half of our genome from our mother and the other half from our father. Every gene in our body is represented by two copies, and both are expressed together. Gene expression is the process in which the genome produces the final product, which is a protein, enzyme, or polypeptide. We are made up of a bunch, a whole bunch of such proteins. So, this final product is the result of mixing the mother’s and father’s copies of the gene. We inherit one copy, the other copy, mix them, and use them. This is how most of the genes in our body work, the vast majority. Our body has about 20,000 genes in total. But there is a special, small group of genes that follow completely different rules: the rules of genomic imprinting. So, we have a mother’s copy of a gene and a father’s copy. In the case of the vast majority of genes, both copies are activated, meaning they work together. Therefore, they will give a unified phenotypic trait, such as nose shape, ear shape, eye color, leg length, anything, everything. However, in the case of imprinted genes, only one copy will be active. The second copy will always be deactivated. In some genes that follow the rules of imprinting, only the mother’s copy will be active, and in others, only the father’s. The information about activating and deactivating copies is encoded at the epigenetic level.
