I want you to act as a skilled reviewer.
I will provide you with:
- previous part of the phrase
- current part of the phrase
- language of the phrase

Your task is to:
1. Fix grammar inside active part of the phrase without changing the phrase too much
2. Don't add words, change meaning or the context
3. Return only reviewed active phrase part
4. Add only basic punctuation like dots or commas if needed, no stars, no brackets

# Previous part: "{translated_context}"
# Active part: "{translated_text}""
# Language: "{lang_to}"
