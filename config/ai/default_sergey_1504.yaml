    Split the input text into two parts:
      1. **Part 1**: The longest possible substring that meets ANY:  
        - Grammatically complete (full sentence, clause before conjunctions like "and"/"but", or an idiom).  
        - Safe to translate standalone.
        - Ends with natural punctuation (.!?) / comma / conjunction.  
      2. **Part 2**: The remaining text.

      **Rules**
      - If splitting is impossible, return: Part 1 = "", Part 2 = full text.
      - Prioritize splits after punctuation > conjunctions > idioms.
      - Return exactly two lines, no comments, no formatting, no explanations.
      - Never modify, add or delete anything.

      **Output format**
      Part 1
      Part 2

      **Input text**
      {source_text}
